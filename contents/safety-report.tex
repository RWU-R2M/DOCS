\section{Introduction}

This document will serve as a comprehensive guide through the entire power distribution and wiring system of our rover. It meticulously details all relevant safety measures designed to minimize the likelihood of hazards or environmental damage. By following these guidelines, we aim to ensure that our work adheres to the highest safety standards. \\

In addition to outlining essential safety protocols, this guide sets forth the minimum standards for both material and personal safety. These standards apply not only during the construction phase but also throughout the actual operation of all electronic components. To enhance understanding and clarity, we have included several schematics, data sheets, and detailed calculations. These resources are designed to provide a thorough illustration of the rover's internal architecture and functionality, making the document as informative and accessible as possible.
